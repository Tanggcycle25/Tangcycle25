    <h1>My story with the cycling </h1>

    <p><strong>Do you know the movie Asterix & Obelix?</strong><small><em>(If not don’t worry!)</em></small></p>

    <p>The story tells that Obelix fell into the magic potion when he was a baby, right? Well, it's the same thing for me but I fell into cycling world...</p>
    
    <p>Cycling is also my dad's passion.</p>
    
    <h2>My godfather</h2>
    
    <p>Indeed, I am born exactly the morning my dad was organizing a big cycling race in my city. Normally, I was supposed to be born 20 days later but I think I just wanted to see the race. And this is only the beginning of my story with cycling...</p>
    <p>That particular day, one of the greatest cyclists of all time, was at my home,

    <p>He came to see me a few hours after my birth and I think he transmitted to me this love of cycling. But that's not all, above all, he became my <strong>godfather.</strong><em> (Cycling came to me before I could even know it …)</em></p>
    
    <h2>My dad</h2>

    <p>During the weekends, my dad goes all over France to animate cycling races, in addition to his work.</p>
    
    <p>As soon as I knew how to walk and talk, I went with him and that's how I could start dreaming when I saw in reality the athletes who were on TV:</p>

    <p><em>Dreaming was fine but doing is better for me … It was precisely the problem...</em></p>
    
    <p>Until I was 13 years old, my parents didn't want to allow me to do cycling in competition... So, I played tennis and football during several years and when I was 13, I began competing.</p>
    
    <p>I quickly got into the competition game and it became a way of life:
    </p>
    
    <ol><strong>
      <li>School</li>
      <li>Bike</li>
      <li>Sleep</li></strong>
    </ol>
    <p><em>And repeat!</em></p>
    
    <h2> First race and first victory</h2>

    <p>Almost my whole life is about this sport. All my social networks are full of photos, video, news about cycling. My favorite web page is not Facebook but <a href= "https://www.directvelo.com/">DirectVelo</a>. Also, thanks to the competitions, I could meet great friends with whom I am still in touch even if we don't do any more races and trips together but… All good things have an end.And the end came...but maybe not definitively.</p>
    
    <p>Since I am in post-graduate studies, I have reduced my number of races as I can train less because of the internships and stays abroad.
    </p>
    
    <p>Now, you know my biggest passion but also a large part of my history up to now. I hope you liked it because other articles to get to know me will be published soon.</p>
